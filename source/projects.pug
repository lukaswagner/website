        | [TS] visual dataset inspector: 
        | Web-based 3D scatter plot viewer for huge data sets (1M - 100M 
        | entries). Leverages WebGL 2 for hardware-accelerated rendering, 
        | facilitating plotting of millions of data points at interactive frame 
        | rates. Supports free mapping of numerical columns to 3D coordinates 
        | and visual variables (size, color). Utilizes additional render 
        | buffers and picking to embed controls into the 3D scene. Embeds 
        | x-ray-like 2D density maps to avoid 3D occlusion issues. See

    +row('uebungsrahmen', 'uebungsrahmen')
        | [JS/TS] Web-based coding exercise framework (with Node.js backend). 
        | Designed to be customizable and reusable between lectures. 
        | Employed repeatedly alongside computer graphics lectures for 
        | accompanying exercises using WebGL (see 
        a(href='#teaching') teaching
        | ), with consistent positive feedback by students. 
        | Provides automated import/export of assignments and solutions.
        | Also includes teaching assistant quality-of-life features such as sample solution 
        | removal and state cleanup during code reviews. 
        | Controlled using CLI or electron-based GUI.
