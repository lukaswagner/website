            *Research assistang* at Hasso Plattner Institute, Computer Graphics Systems chair.

            Research Focus: Development of a *web-based 3D scatter plot viewer*
            (see #[vidi], #[Web3D 2022], #[Web3D 2020]).

            Teaching Focus: Lectures *3D computer graphics I* and *II* (see #[teaching]),
            design and development of accompanying exercises: WebGL-2-based implementations of 
            various fundamental rendering techniques (e.g. shadow rendering, environment mapping,
            post-processing effects such as SSAO), design and implementation of exercise
            #[framework](uebungsrahmen).
